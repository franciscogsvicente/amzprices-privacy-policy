    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <h2>Last Updated: August 6, 2024</h2>
    <p>
      AmzPrices ("we," "us," "our") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy
      explains how we handle your information when you use our Chrome extension
      (the "Extension"). By using the Extension, you agree to the terms of this
      Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Information Collection and Use</h3>
    <p>
      We do not collect, store, or share any personal information or data from
      your use of the Extension. The Extension operates entirely on your local
      device and does not send any data to our servers or third parties.

    <h3>2. No Account or Login Required</h3>
    <p>
      The Extension does not require you to create an account or log in. You can

      information.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Permissions</h3>
    <p>
      The Extension may request certain permissions to function correctly, such
      as access to your browser tabs or history. These permissions are strictly
      used to provide the functionality of the Extension and are not used to
      collect or transmit data.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Data Security</h3>
    <p>
      As we do not collect any data, we do not store or process any user

      the Extension itself and ensure a secure experience for our users.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>
      The Extension does not use or integrate with any third-party services that
      collect or track your information.
    </p>
